# Node JS Course

Node JS is a JS runtime

## Local Modules

- In node js, each file is a module that is isolated by default.
- To load a module in another file we use the require function.
- When we executed a file (index.js) then the module(add.js) also gets executed if we import (add.js) in (index.js).
- We can use the functionality of (add.js) in (index.js) but we cannot have control over the value of (add.js) TO CONTROL THE VALUE OF THAT FUNCTIONALITY WE USE modules.export ()
